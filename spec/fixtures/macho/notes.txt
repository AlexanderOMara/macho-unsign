Ran on 10.6.8 with Xcode 3.2.6:
./build-1-notsigned-ppc-intel.sh
./build-2-signed-ppc-intel.sh

Ran on 10.15.7 with Command Line Tools for Xcode 12.2:
./build-1-notsigned-arm.sh
./build-2-signed.sh
./build-3-unsigned.sh
./build-4-fat.sh

The older codesign fails to unsign binaries properly.
Must use a newer version for that step.
Removal does not update __LINKEDIT VM Size property, otherwise identical to notsigned.
Apple Silicon ARM binaries always have a signature when created.
